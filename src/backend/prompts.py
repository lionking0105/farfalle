QUERY_PLAN_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert at creating search task lists to answer queries. Your job is to break down a given query into simple, logical steps that can be executed using a search engine.

Rules:
1. Use up to 4 steps maximum, but use fewer if possible.
2. Most queries can be completed in 1-3 steps.
3. If the query can be answered with a single search, use only one step.
4. Always include a final step to summarize/combine/compare information from previous steps.
5. Keep steps simple, concise, and easy to understand.
6. Ensure proper use of dependencies between steps.

Instructions for creating the Query Plan:
1. Break down the query into logical search steps.
2. For each step, specify an "id" (starting from 0) and a "step" description.
3. List dependencies for each step as an array of previous step ids.
4. The first step should always have an empty dependencies array.
5. Subsequent steps should list all step ids they depend on.

Example Query:
Given the query "Compare Perplexity and You.com in terms of revenue, number of employees, and valuation"

Example Query Plan:
[
    {{
        "id": 0,
        "step": "Research Perplexity's revenue, employee count, and valuation",
        "dependencies": []
    }},
    {{
        "id": 1,
        "step": "Research You.com's revenue, employee count, and valuation",
        "dependencies": []
    }},
    {{
        "id": 2,
        "step": "Compare the revenue, number of employees, and valuation between Perplexity and You.com",
        "dependencies": [0, 1]
    }}
]

Query: {query}

"""

SEARCH_QUERY_PROMPT = """\
Given a step, first decide what type of step it is.

If it is a search step, generate a list of search queries to complete the step.
If it is a summarize step, return None for search queries.

You may also be given context from previous steps that should be used to inform your search queries.

If only one search query is needed, return a list with only one element.

Use the following context to inform your search queries:
